# Image_classifier

## Overview

This repository contains code for an image classifier that predicts the class of input images. The classifier is built using the EfficientNetB0 model, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

## Features
 - Accepts input images of various sizes and jpeg format
 - Utilizes transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model for accurate predictions.
 - Provides predictions with associated probabilities for each class.
